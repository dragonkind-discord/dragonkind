## &useHelp
Enables the help channel plugin. NOTE: This is dependent upon the plugin being present upon the host computer (running the `bot.py` program) and there being the proper categories:<br>
* Available channels
* Claimed channels
* plus the help channels themselves!

## &stopHelp
Stops the help channels plugin from running.

## &useFinanceApi
Enables the finance API plugin. NOTE: This is dependent upon the plugin being present upon the host computer (running the `bot.py` program).

## &stopFinanceApi
Stops the finance API plugin from running.

## &doit
Try this command and never use it again. This command makes the bot angry. ðŸ˜¡

## &dmInfo
Gets your information specifically.

# Dev commands
These require the role "dev" to be given.
## &hackem `user`
Gets information about `user`: username, discriminator and roles.
## &ping `site`
Uses "ping `site`" from Windows Command Prompt. This is a developer command due to the fact that it uses the host computer's Command Prompt, and these windows popping up can be quite annoying!

# User-specific commands
These commands can be used by one user and ONLY one user- the creator of this bot.

## sendAllServers `message`
This command is only used to send a message to all servers this robot is in, probably about the latest version released.
