# Command updates
There have been a few changes to commands:
* `hackem` is now `getInfo`
* `getInfo` is now available to all users
* `useHelp`, `useFinanceApi`, and the stop equivalent commands have been removed (they don't work)
* `dmInfo` has been removed (likely to not be used)
* `join` and `leave` allow the bot to join/leave your voice channel

# Commands
## &whatsnew

## &doit
Try this command and never use it again. This command makes the bot a little frustrated. Lol.

## &getInfo `user`
Gets information about `user`: username, account creation date, and roles. This command is now open to all users.

## &join
If you are connected to a voice channel, the bot will connect to it.

## &leave
Leaves the voice channel.
